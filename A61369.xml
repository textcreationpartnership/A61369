            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>The longeſt Line of Defence K A not to be above 12 ſcore Yards, that is, 720 Foot, being within Musket-ſhot; and the breadth of the Rampire to reſiſt the Battery 100 Foot.</p>

               <head>To Deſcribe a Fort of Five Bulwarks, or any other; ſo that the Baſtion, or Flanked Angle of <hi>8</hi> Baſtions or Bulwarks exceed not <hi>90</hi> Degrees by the Line of Chords.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, Draw an Obſcure Line, as A B; and upon A, as a Center, with the Chord of 60 <hi>deg.</hi> deſcribe an Arch, as C D E; and from C lay down half the Polygon Angle (which in the Table following the Figure you ſhall find to be) 54 <hi>deg.</hi> as C D; alſo the ſame again from D to E, and draw the Line A E. Now divide the half Polygon Arches C D and D E each into three equal parts, as in F H I G, and from two of thoſe parts from D, as F and G, draw Lines unto the Baſtion Point at A. Then take any convenient Diſtance, and lay the ſame on thoſe Lines from A unto K and L, which ſhall make the Front or Face of the Bulwark. Next, from the ſhoulder at K let fall a Perpendicular to A B, as K M; and on the Center at K deſcribe an Arch of 60 <hi>deg.</hi> from M towards N, and from M lay down on the ſame Arch 50 <hi>deg.</hi> or more exact 49 <hi>deg.</hi> 24 <hi>min.</hi> and ſo draw K N, which will cut the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter of the Polygon in the Point O; ſo ſhall A O be the Capital Line of the Baſtion. Then from O draw a Line parallel to A B, as O P; ſo ſhall you have O R for the Gorge Line, and R K the Flank. Now for the Curtain, take half the Front A K, as A T, and lay it down three times from R towards P, which will fall in S; ſo is R S the Curtain. Then on the Point at Serect a Perpendicular, as S V, equal to R K, which ſhall be the Flank of another Baſtion; and ſo the Front K A being laid from V, ſhall cut the firſt Line A B in B; ſo drawing V B, you have the Front of the ſame Baſtion.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Divide A B in the middle, as in W, and from W let fall a Perpendicular to A B, which will cut the Semidiameter of the Polygon in the Point D; ſo is D the Center of the Polygon. And with the ſame Semidiameter D A you muſt deſcribe a whole Circle, of the which A B is the ⅕ part thereof, which Diſtance will reach from B unto X, and from X unto Y, and ſo to Z, and your firſt Point at A, where you begun your Work.</p>
               <p>For the other Baſtions, they may be eaſily tranſported from the firſt Baſtion. And note, That if your Fort exceed 8 Bulwarks, you muſt add 15 <hi>deg.</hi> to half the Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon Angle, ſo have you the Baſtion Angle; and then work as before. But in the Forts that exceed not 8 Bulwarks, where the Baſtion Angle will not be above 90 <hi>deg.</hi> you muſt take the ⅔ part of the Angle of the Polygon.</p>
               <p>The longeſt Line of Defence is from A unto Q, and ſhould not exceed 720 Foot (becauſe of being within Musket-ſhot) the Curtain R S about 420 Foot, and the Front A K 280 Foot: And for the Flank R K, and Gorge R O, their proportion commonly is as 6 to 7: but the Angle K O R forming the Flank is about 40 <hi>gr.</hi> by which the Proportion is neer as 5 to 6.</p>

               <p>LEt it be required to draw the Proportional Dimenſion of a Regular Fort of 6 Sides: As for Example, in the fourth Figure, whoſe Side A B muſt be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into 100 equal parts, and each part ſuppoſed to be ſubdivided into 10 parts: ſo have you 1000 parts, which ſhall ſuffice. Now proceeding according to former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, until you come to make choice of your Capital Line, you ſhall here find in the ſecond Table, which is beſt for the purpoſe, under the Figure 6, and right againſt the word <hi>Capital</hi> in the firſt Column, 2602, but 260 will ſerve: Take the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106336:5"/>ſame from the Scale of Equal parts, and lay it from the Baſtion Point at A, and it falls in the Point E, which will be the Center of the Baſtion. From thence you may lay down the Gorge Line out of the Table, which is 148 unto M: So will the Front A L be 296, and the Flank M L. The Curtain, being once and a half the length of the Front, will be M N 444. Thus you may do for any of the reſt.

               <head>Of Irregular Fortification.</head>
               <p>IN the ſeventh Figure following let A B C D E be an Irregular Fort, containing 5 Baſtions, or Bulwarks. Firſt we will make a Baſtion on the Angle at A, which do thus: Divide the Polygon Angle in half with the Line A F, and draw the Baſtion-Angle as formerly, being ⅔ of the Polygon-Angle, as A H, and A I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, being the Sides whereon the Fronts muſt be laid down.</p>
               <p>Now upon ſome ſpare Paper you ſhall make the half Polygon-Angle G A F, as you may ſee underneath this ſeventh Figure, as L K M: Then make choice of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Line, as before; let it be of any convenient length (larger than you think your Baſtion will be in the ſeventh Figure) as underneath K N, and from N the Center of the Gorge draw a Parallel to K L, continued to O, as N P; and ſo proceeding as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you ſhall find the Point of the ſecond Baſtion at O: So have you the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Baſtions, whereby you may gain thoſe in the ſeventh Figure.</p>
               <p>Now to reduce it from the Baſtion Point at A, you muſt take A B the ſhorteſt ſide, and lay it from O unto Q; and from Q draw a Line parallel to the Capital Line K N continued, as Q R. Laſtly, drawing a Line from N to O, it ſhall cut Q R in the Point S; ſo is Q S the length of the Capital Line ſought for, which muſt be laid down on the ſeventh Figure from A unto T; ſo is T the Center of the Gorge. Then for the Front take K V, and lay it on the Capital Line from K to W: ſo a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler being laid from W to O, it ſhall cut the Line Q R in the Point at X; ſo is Q X the length of the Front, to be laid down in the ſeventh Figure from A unto H and I. Thus ſhall you finiſh your Baſtion, when you have let fallen your Flanks perpendicular on the ends of your Curtains, as you ſee. The like Method you are to obſerve for the other Baſtions.</p>
               <p>And when you have finiſhed your Fort, you muſt obſerve whether your Curtain Lines (that is, from the Centers of the Gorge) be parallel to the outward Sides A B, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which if they are not, you muſt correct them; and by your Judgment, by help of the Lines of Defence, you may as you ſee occaſion widen the Necks of the Gorges, and alſo the Baſtion Angles; but not above 90 Degrees: And ſo let the Flankers be as neer proportional as the Rules (or Ocular Demonſtration directeth) which commonly the Gorge Line to the Flank bears proportion as 7 to 6.</p>

               <p>Make your Scale of a ſufficient length, that may hold both Lines, the one for 12 Sides, and the other for 8. Make choice within the breadth of the Scale, between the Borders, any ſufficient breadth, as C D; from whence draw Parallels to the Sides, and divide C D into 30 Equal parts, and begin your Account from C with 45: ſo ſhall the end at D be 75 <hi>degr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now make choice of the length of the outer Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygon, which here I make three Inches; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide a Line by the Side thereof, equal thereto, in 100 equal parts, and ſuppoſe each part into 10; ſo have you 1000 parts, agreeable to the Tables. The next thing is to draw Parallels to C E, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Polygon half Angles, as you may ſee in the Tables under the Pentagon Fort, being the ſecond Figure: So from the Scale C D you have for the half Angle of a Pentagon 54 Degrees, whereby you may draw the Pentagon parallel F G; and ſo in the lower Scale of 8 Baſtions. In the like manner you may do for all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Now to draw the croſs Lines for the Semidiame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Inner Polygons, as alſo the Lines for the Fronts, Gorges, and Flanks, you ſhall work thus. Firſt, you muſt note, That the Semidiameter of the Outer Polygon is the Radius or whole Line of 1000
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106336:7"/>equal parts, and that is drawn at Right Angles, or a croſs at F: But for the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameter of the Inner Polygon, look in the Table of 12 Sides in the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn under 4, you have 661. Take the ſame Number off your Scale of Equal Parts, and lay it from E to H: Then in the third Column under 5 you have 700 parts; lay the ſame down from G to I, and make there a prick or point: Do the like for the <hi>Hexagon</hi> and <hi>Heptagon,</hi> as at I and K; proceeding along with all the reſt, unto the <hi>Dodecagon.</hi> And laſtly, draw a Line through all thoſe Points: So have you the Arch Line H M for the Semidiameters of the Inner Polygon. In the ſame manner work for the Front, Gorge, and Flank Lines. The Scale of 8 Sides is the ſame Method.</p>
               <p>I have alſo inſerted on the left ſide of the Scale a Line of Chords, whoſe Radius (or Arch of 60 Degrees) is three Inches; and on the left ſide, a Line for the Sides of the Polygons. The <hi>Hexagon,</hi> or ſix Sides, is equal to the Radius: And for the <hi>Tetragon,</hi> or four Sides, it is equal to the Chord of 90 Degrees. So having deſcribed a whole Circle with the Chord of 60 Degrees, you ſhall find, that if you take from the Center N unto 5, it ſhall divide the Circle into 5 equal parts, for drawing the Figure of a <hi>Pentagon,</hi> which in the ſecond Figure of a <hi>Pentagon</hi> Fort will reach from A to B, and ſo to X, Y, Z, and A. Now D A in the ſame ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Figure you ſhall find to be the Semidiameter of the Outer Polygon, which in the Scale is G F; and taking G I off the Scale for 12 Baſtions, or G O on the Scale of 8 Baſtions, it will give the Semidiameter of the Inner Polygon, as D E in the ſame Figure. So likewiſe G P on the Scale will be equal to the Front A K in the <hi>Pentagon</hi> Fort. The like you may underſtand for laying down the Gorge and the Flank. And for the Curtain, as before, you muſt make R S 1 ½ the length of the Front A K.</p>
               <p>This Scale will alſo be of good Uſe in Irregular Fortification. As for Inſtance. In the Irregular Fort, the ſeventh Figure, you ſhall find the half Baſtion Angle G A F to be 58 Degrees, which falls on the Scale between the <hi>Pentagon</hi> and <hi>Hexagon,</hi> from whence you may draw a Baſtion on ſome ſpare place, and from thence proportionate the ſame unto the outer ſide of the ſeventh Figure A B. The reſt I leave to your own practice.</p>

               <head>How to Fortifie a long Curtain with Bulwarks, or a ſtrait Town Wall.</head>
               <figure/>
               <p>LEt the Curtain be A B. Firſt take 200 Foot from the Scale of Fortification, accounting 10 for 100; and lay the ſame from A unto C, and from C unto D: So ſhall A D be the breadth of the Neck of the Gorge: and upon the Point C erect a Perpendicular, as C F. Then take 420 Foot off your Scale, and lay the ſame from D to E, which ſhall be the length of the Curtain. Next you muſt take 720 Foot, and lay the ſame from E, to cut off the Capital Line at F; ſo ſhall E F be the longeſt Line of Defence, and C F the Capital Line; which Line C F muſt be laid down from C unto G: and draw G F for the ſhorteſt Line of Defence. Laſtly, upon D erect a Perpendicular, which will cut the ſame Line in H: ſo have you D H for the Flank, and H F the Front. Thus have you finiſhed half the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, from whence you may tranſport all the reſt of the Baſtions, were they ever ſo many.</p>
               <p>Note, That theſe Baſtions muſt not exceed 720 Foot, that ſo it may not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Musket-ſhot. But if you will defend the Front with Cannon, you may make the Line of Defence almoſt twice ſo much. The like for the Curtain, which may be 800 Foot; and in the middle of the Curtain you may make a Spur, or Point of a Baſtion, as at K, which will be neceſſary for Musket-ſhot, beſide the Cannon; which in the Line drawn about the City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> I have ſeen many of them.</p>
